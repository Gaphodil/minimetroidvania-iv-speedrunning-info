# Route

Start off in the Grassy Stones.

Complete the *Everchanging Trial* and receive **Toggling objects on Jump**. Head right to complete *The Second Trial* and receive **Double Jump**. If you're familiar enough with locations, skip the map.

Go up-left or left-up (unsure which is faster), and touch the **teleporter**. From there, the route splits. I make the assumption that right is slower (also I didn't even realize it could be done at first) and so I go into less detail.

## Left first

Follow the path in Ocean Spray by going left-left-down-down.

Complete the *Wet Descent* to obtain **Swimming/Jump in Water**. Restarting at the second save on the way out activates multiple triggers, so you can skip the save entirely by going up and right.

Arrive at the **teleporter**. Warp back to Grassy Stones, then go down-left into a one-screen section of Ocean Spray. There is a skip here; descend the shaft (with or without the water), and while doing so, shoot across the screen to spawn another row of water. Use this second row to jump over the large triangle of triangles and reach the trial. Complete *Split Attention* - you can press restart after the success jingle for the first two rooms to skip part of the cutscene. Use the newly obtained **Water Torrent** to leave the way you came.

Warp back to Ocean Spray from Grassy Stones. Use Torrent to head up-right to Chilly Peaks, then up-up to *Bounding Beyond*, which rewards you **Wind Gust**. Leave by heading down-down-right to the **teleporter**.

Head right-down-right to the Volcanic Crag **teleporter**, then head up. You can do a skip with the platforms by jumping to the second, then using Wind Gust (with or without jump-cancelling) to reach the first platform on the first cycle. Obtain **Fire Bullets** from *Ingenious Igneous*.

Return to Chilly Peaks by going down-left-up, then go up and up again.
You can skip some of the right-side jumps of the middle room with Wind Gust, and bonk to go under the rolling rocks and skip needing Iron Boots.
You can skip the bottom right of the final room by jump-cancelling Wind Gust to land on the left of the first set of wood blocks.

Complete *Launching Lunacy* and get **Mistform**. There is a gigantic skip after the fourth save's second jump; instead of walking off to the right, launch left and up to land on the platform above, one jump into the final save.

(Outside of this, there are probably a lot of smaller skips about; one is in the top left, where you can go above a spike but below the killplane to be one jump into the next save. Another is a walkoff bonk not-diagonal from one jump before the third save, to one after the fourth, which barely saves any time and isn't worth it.)

Use Mistform to go through the spikes on the left side into the next room. Head back to the Volcanic Crag teleporter. Teleport to Grassy Stones and use Wind Gust to go up and steal the **prism of light**. Warp back to Volcanic Crag and head down-left. Use Mistform to go down and steal the **clockwork tools**.

There is a skip in this room, allowing the clock to be reached without Iron Boots. Shoot the closest set of dry thorns and jump-cancel Wind Gust to land on the topmost blocks, then land where the thorns were. Jump to the left and do a precise Wind Gust to dip under the block and spike. Set the clock (11AM to 11PM).

Head up twice. Skip the platforming on the left with Wind Gust as intended, then jump-cancel Wind Gust across the small lava pool to skip the trigger and platform avoidance.

Climb the *Surging Ascent* (save and restart to skip the cutscene) and get **Iron Boots**.

### Summary

Grab the Grassy Stones teleporter. Head left to Ocean Spray and down to get **Swimming**.

Warp from Ocean Spray to Grassy Stones. Get **Water Torrent**.

Warp from Grassy Stones to Ocean Spray. Go up Chilly Peaks to get **Wind Gust**.

Go right to Volcanic Crag. Get **Fire Bullets**.

Go back up Chilly Peaks to get **Mistform**.

Warp from Volcanic Crag to Grassy Stones. Get the **prism of light**.

Warp from Grassy Stones to Volcanic Crag. Get the **clockwork tools**.

Do a skip to reach the clock before getting **Iron Boots**.

### Clean-up

Now begins clock repair simulator. Considerations are that the last room in a set of three will reset the room state due to the gate cutscene, and that it's probably faster to go from the lower clock in Chilly Peaks straight to final.

Return to the teleporter, using Wind Gust and Mistform. Do the clock in the room above first (2 to 1) due to room state resetting.

There is a skip in this room. Jump-cancel Wind Gust to skip the nerfed drop gate, then do it again as a backup to failing the wood block puzzle (I do not know the actual solution lol).

Finish with the teleporter room clock (1 to 4). Try not to die leaving. You should now be at Volcanic Crag teleporter with all its clocks cleaned. Options now include climbing to Chilly Peaks or warping to Grassy Stones or Ocean Spray.


General considerations for Grassy Stones:
- bottom right should ideally not be last; the Wind Gust in can be jump-cancelled easily
- bottom left can also be entered with jump-cancelled Wind Gust, though it is slightly tighter
- prism room can be entered with Wind Gust. Top right can be skipped with Mistform from above or very precise Wind Gust jump-cancelling

General considerations for Ocean Spray:
- all clocks will have respawning blocks; top left and bottom are the worst offenders
- entering from Chilly Peaks flows nicely to Grassy Stones and vice versa
  - starting from teleporter should probably act as if starting from Grassy Stones - the gap can be easily crossed with Wind Gust jump-cancelling
- enter top left with Water Torrent and Wind Gust
  - boss item can be skipped
  - on the return, use Mistform to float across the horizontal wind field

General considerations for Chilly Peaks:
- both center rooms during climbs to clocks can be greatly sped up with Mistform
- you can also skip needing Iron Boots for entering the boss by falling into the side of the wind block (lol)


Here is a possible clock route, after completing Volcanic Crag's clocks:
- go directly to Chilly Peaks right clock (10 to 1)
- use Volcanc Crag teleporter to Grassy Stones
- go down-right to do the right clock first (4 to 9), then do the one in the teleporter room (2PM to 6AM)
- do the topmost clock in Grassy Stones (7 to 4), then navigate left to Ocean Spray
- do the right clock (11 to 6), then the bottom (3PM to 7PM), then the top left (8 to 12) in Ocean Spray
- head straight right to do Chilly Peaks' left clock (5 to 7), then fight Him and finish off Chilly Peaks (4AM to 1PM)
- enter the final area

## Right first

Grabbing the Grassy Stones teleporter is optional but recommended.

Go to Volcanic Crag and get both **Iron Boots** and **Fire Bullets**. (it might be possible to jump-cancel into the Mistform column entry wind without Iron Boots, but it would be very difficult)

From the teleporter, enter Chilly Peaks and get **Mistform**.

Go left into Ocean Spray and use Mistform to reach **Swimming**.

Return to Grassy Stones (probably warp) and get **Water Torrent**.

Warp to Chilly Peaks and get **Wind Gust**.

After getting the **prism of light** and the **clockwork tools**, the routes converge.

### Speculation

If you choose to fight the bosses of Grassy Stones and Volcanic Crag (and win quickly) you may ultimately save time by being able to do certain clocks on the way rather than all at the end. The ones in the rooms containing Swimming and Wind Gust come to mind, and they are both out of the way otherwise.

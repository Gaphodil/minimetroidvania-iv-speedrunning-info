This will mainly document changes that affect known skips or are relevant to the route.

After getting Swim, restarting at the save no longer moves the spikes, so the subsequent skip is no longer possible on the first entry. When returning for the clock, however, this remains possible - assuming the clock is not the third correct entry in Ocean Spray.

When getting Water Torrent, you can still shoot across the screen to summon two water jets, and land on the block. [video](https://i.imgur.com/5B33gO4.mp4)

In *Ingenious Igneous*, you can still skip part of the second room by freezing the bottom two rows as normal, then reaching the top row by jumping up from the second platform while in the center. [video](https://i.imgur.com/fCbRxCx.mp4)

The boss of Volcanic Crag can no longer be skipped. (This may affect optimal pathing.)

The first save of the water section of final can no longer be skipped.

The clock adjustment animation is greatly sped up.

## Always Available

After getting Swim, restarting at the second save activates multiple moving spikes, which you can use to skip the left side of the screen.

When getting Water Torrent, instead of going over the top to the save, you can go down and shoot across the screen to summon another water jet, which can be used to cross the large obstacle. [video](https://i.imgur.com/7sqMMGq.mp4)

In *Split Attention*, you can press restart after the success jingles of the first two rooms. (If you do this in the last room, the Kid is missing - you can fix this by quitting to title (F2) and reloading.)

In *Surging Ascent*, you can skip the opening cutscene by saving and restarting.

In *Launching Lunacy*, after the second jump of the fourth save, you can launch from the left side of the block to just after the last save. [video](https://i.imgur.com/qM8kNeF.mp4)

### Final Area

On the first save of the water section, you can ascend on the left side of the screen, skipping two saves.

## Item Specific (Mostly Wind Gust Jump-Cancelling)

You can skip the boss of Grassy Stones by using Wind Gust.

You can skip the boss of Ocean Spray by using Water Torrent and Wind Gust.

You can skip the boss of Volcanic Crag by using Mistform.

You can use a Wind Gust to one-cycle the two platform pillars that lead to Fire Bullets. [video](https://i.imgur.com/iUsiIbc.mp4)

You can use a jump-cancelled Wind Gust to cross the lake of lava in front of Iron Boots. [video](https://i.imgur.com/QRlqbWv.mp4)

You can non-obviously skip portions of the Mistform column by using or jump-cancelling Wind Gust. [video](https://i.imgur.com/Xcpb0nD.mp4)


## Clocks

### Grassy Stones

You can ascend both lower clocks' columns easily by jump-cancelling Wind Gust.

You can skip the upper-right portion of the top clock by landing right of the wood block with Mistform (or a very precise jump-cancelled Wind Gust).

### Volcanic Crag

You can use jump-cancelled Wind Gusts to skip the wood block puzzle at the upper clock. [video](https://i.imgur.com/9N47eAh.mp4)

At the lower clock, you can jump-cancel a Wind Gust to land on the block with the first dry thorns, then use a well timed Wind Gust to slip into the upper left. [video](https://i.imgur.com/MFRim93.mp4)
